## mag06.github.io

A [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) repo for some pet projects and general sandboxing. 

This page originated as a clone of Karl Broman's [tutorial](https://kbroman.org/simple_site). I have also borrowed some code from the Jekyll-based blog of [Mojombo](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
