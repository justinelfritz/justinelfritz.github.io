title: GPS Mapping of C&O Canal and Great Allegheny Passage
description: 
---

#### Motivation
During Spring and Summer 2025 I am mapping the [Chesapeake \& Ohio Canal](https://www.nps.gov/choh/index.htm) (C\&O Canal) between Washington D.C. and Cumberland MD. In parallel I am mapping the [Great Allegheny Passage](https://gaptrail.org/) (GAP) that runs from Cumberland MD to Pittsburgh PA. Precise GPS and elevation data will be gathered for the trail and shared freely here wtihin GPX files. In areas where multiple paths exist, for example along the Western Maryland Rail Trail, best efforts will be made to provide data for all routes. Having reliable, accurate data can empower reluctant cyclists and remove uncertainty during planning. 

The tables below contain milepost information for the GAP trail. Mileage info for C&O is being added soon.
