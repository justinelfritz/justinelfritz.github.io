<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:1.5em;"> This repository is home to my public-facing projects and documentation in applied mathematics, physics, and data science. I also host various code snippets and miscellanous notes here.</span>

<span style="font-size:1.5em;"> Some aspects of my professional scientific background can be found in the [about me](https://mag06.github.io/pages/about.html) page.</span>
